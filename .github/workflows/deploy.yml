name: Disabled — Deploy to GitHub Pages

# This workflow previously deployed the site to GitHub Pages. It's been
# disabled because the repository no longer uses GitHub Pages deployment.
#
# Keeping a disabled workflow file avoids accidental re-enablement while
# preserving history. This workflow has no triggers and will not run.
