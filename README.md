## Deploy to GitHub Pages

This repository is configured to deploy to GitHub Pages. The Vite config sets the correct base path for the `hogwarts-points-react` repo and there's a `deploy` script that uses `gh-pages`.

Quick steps to publish:

```bash
# install dependencies (and the gh-pages package included in devDependencies)
npm install

# build for production
npm run build

# publish the `dist/` folder to GitHub Pages
npm run deploy
```

Notes:

- Make sure your GitHub repository is `github.com/<your-username>/hogwarts-points-react` (the `homepage` field in `package.json` points to `https://janithRS.github.io/hogwarts-points-react`).
- Use Node 18+ (or 20 LTS). Older Node versions may fail when running `vite build`.
- The site will be published to the `gh-pages` branch by the `gh-pages` package. You can also set the Pages source in the repo settings to the `gh-pages` branch if GitHub doesn't switch automatically.

```
npm install

# build for production
npm run build

# publish the `dist/` folder to GitHub Pages
npm run deploy
```
